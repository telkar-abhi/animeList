<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

TL;DR: AnYme uses [Fabric](https://docs.fabric.io/android/fabric/data-privacy.html) to improve its services. It's used to track very basic user data, like what Android version you have, what happened before the app crashed etc. Other than tracking device info, I also track which screens in the app are used the most. I use this information to decide what issue or new features requires more priority. If you don't want to be tracked, add Fabric to your AdBlocker. 

thanks.
